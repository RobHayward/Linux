### Man pages
Various options
1. `-f` will dispaly all pages that contain the word in the argument
2. `-k` will display all discussion even if the word is not used

Man pages are divided into 9 chapters. The chapter number can be forced by the number.  The `a` parameter will display all manual pages with the given name.
* `man 3 printf`
* `man -a printf`

###GNU information system
This is more free-form and open to linkages. 

Typing `info` with no arguments in the command line gives a list of topics. `info <topic name` will give information on the topic. To negotiate the page
* q will quit
* h will help
* enter to select
* n go to next node
* p go to previous node
* u one node in the index

### Help command
Will tend to provide short information.  For example, to find out about manual `man --help`

###Other
`gnome help` will provide specific help about the particular linux family.
