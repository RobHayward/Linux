## Introduction
This comes from the [edX class](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x.2+1T2015/courseware)

List of commands
1. `apt` - advanced package tool

The main sources of information
1. Man pages
2. Command help
3. GNU info
4. Other
5. [https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/](https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/)

### Man pages
Various options
1. `-f` will dispaly all files that contain the word in the argument
2. `-k` will display all discussion even if the word is not used

Man pages are divided into 9 chapters. The chapter number can be forced by the number.  The `a` parameter will display all manual pages with the given name.
* `man 3 printf`
* `man -a printf`

###GNU information system
This is more free-form and open to linkages. 

Typing `info` with no arguments in the command line gives a list of topics. `info <topic name` will give information on the topic. To negotiate the page
* q will quite
* h will help
* enter to select
* n go to next node
* p go to previous node
* u one node in the index

### Help command
Will tend to provide short information.  For example, to find out about manual `man --help`

###Other
`gnome help` will provide specific help about the particular linux family. 

##Command line
`X Window` can be turned off. There are 7 `virtual terminals`.  Access by `CTRL-ALT-F6`

Usually there are three components: command, options and arguments.  Options are switches or modifiers. Use `sudo service gdm stop` to stop the desktop manager.

###Basic operations
* cd
* cat
* echo
* ls
* rmdir
* man
* exit
* login
* mkdir

Best to shutdown with `shutdown`, the `init` process will control the shutting down. `shutdown -r` will reboot. Usually, executable programmes are in `/bin/usr/bin/` to find where programmes are use `which <prog>` or `whereis <prog>`.  

###Utilities
* `cd ~` move to home directory
* `cd ..` move to parent
* `cd - ` move to previous directory

###Explore 
* `cd/` Change to root directory
* `ls` list files and directories
* `ls -a ` list all files (including hidden)
* `tree` view of filesystem
* `ln` can create soft or hard links

Move directories to the stack with `pushd .` to move to that first entry in the stack type `pop`.  However, it is best to use `pushd +1` for the first element and `pushd + 2` for the second element.  This will preseve the stack, while `pop` will clear.  Look [here](http://www.eriwen.com/bash/pushd-and-popd/)

###Standard file streams
* standard input `stdin`
* standard output `stdout`
* standard error `stderr`
* pipe can direct output to a new input

###I/O direction
* `do_something < input_file`
* `do_something > output_file`
* `|` pipe moves inputs to outputs
* `locate` will search for files
* `grep` can be used to filer files
* `locate` uses the `updatedb` programme.  This can be run once a day but can be initiated 
at any time
* `find` will find from current directory. `-name` will find only particular name, `-type` will find only particular type.
** `find -name ".swp" -exec rm {} ':'` will remove all the fils with swp extension by sending them to {} to have rm executed on them.
* `-exec` is s modifiction that will allow you to execute commands on the result of the `find`

###Matching files
* `?` match any singe character
* `*` match string of characters
* `[set]` match characters.  
* `[!set]` match not characters
* `-ctime` time file was created
* `-atime` time file was accessed
* `-mtime` time files was modified

###Working with files
* `cat` view short files and link together
* `tac` look file backwards
* `less` view larget file with paging programme (use / to serarch)
* `tail` print last 10 lines. 
* `head`
* `touch` will modify the file's timestamp to the current time.  Can also be used to create a new file. 
* `rm` will remove a file `-i` interactivey will ask for confirmation for each file. 

##Package management
The debian family has two levels of package management: the low level `dpkg` and the high level `apt-get`. The high level tool will mostly call the low level tool when needed. This is *advanced-package-tools*. 

### Operations
* install package: `dpkg --install foo.deb`
* install package dependencies: `apt-get install foo`
* remove package: `dpkg --remove foo.deb`
* remove package dependencies: `apt-get autoremove foo`
* update package: `dpkg --install foo.deb`
* update package and dependencies: `apt-get install foo`
* Update entire system: `apt-get dist-upgrade`
* Show all installed packages: `dpkg --list`
* Get information on package: `dpkg --listfiles foo`
* Show packages named foo: `apt-cache serach foo`
* Show all available packages: `apt-cache dumpavail foo`
* What package is file part of: dpkg --search file`

### User environment
Identify who is logged on with `who`. To identify the current user ``whoami`. `who -a`  gives more details. 

Control of groups is managed through the `/etc/group` file. 

`useradd` will add a new user. `userdel` will remove a user. Use the `-r` option to remove the home directory.

`id` gives user info. 

`su` substitute or switch user. `sudo` super user. Configeration files are in `etc/sudoers`and `etc/sudoers.d` directory. 

First the `/etc/profile` is read and then the following files are searched 

* `~/.bash/profile`
* `~/.bssh/bash_login`
* `~/.profile`

###Environmental variables
Some can be set by the user. An environemnt variable is a character string that contains information that is used by an application. `set`, `env` and `export` are the ways to view the environment variable. 

The `PATH` is an ordered list of directories that will be scanned when a command is given. A null directory or `./` is the current directory. 

**Prompt Statement** is used to customise the prompt string. `PS1` is the primary prompt variable. Changes

* `\u~` User name
* `\h~` host name
* `\w~` current working directory
* `\!~` History number of command
* `\d~` Date

### Command history
This is kept in `~/.bash_histry`.  It is possible to use `!!` or bang-bang to execute previous command. `CTRL-R` search history. 

Keyboard shortcuts

* CTRL-L: Clears the screen
* CTRL-D: Exits current shell
* CTRL-Z: Puts current process in suspended background
* CTRL-C: Kills current process
* CTRL-H: Same as backspace
* CTRL-A: Goes to the beginning of the line
* CTRL-W: Deletes the word before the cursor
* CTRL-U: Deletes from beginning of line to cursor
* CTRL-E: Goes to the end of the line
* Tab: Auto complete

Changes to file ownership. 

* `chown` change user ownership
* `chgrp` change group ownership
* `chmod` modify owner, user or group

The codes for permissions
 
* 4 for read
* 2 for write
* 1 for execute

So 6 for read and write

`chmod 755 test1` would read and execute acess to all and read, write and execute access to owner. 

## Networking

Devices in a network need a unique network address identifier.  This is known as IP (Internet protocol address). Bit-size packets with data buffers and headers are exchanged. There are two types of IP address

* IPv4: uses 32 bits.  Divided into 4 8-bit sections called *octets*. 
* IPv6: uses 128 bits. 

There are five classes of network address:  A, B and C have two components: Network address (Net ID) and Host address (Host ID).  D is for special multicast and E is reserved for future use. 

* Class A uses the first octet as the Net ID and the rest as Host ID. The first bit of the first Octet is set to zero and 000000 and 111111 are reserved, so there are only 126 Class A networks available.  Each class A network can have upto 16.7 million hosts.  The range of host addresses is from 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 (note the value of an octet or 8-bits can range from 0 to 255)

* Class B address use the first two octets as theri Net ID and the last two as the Host ID. The first two digits of the rist octet are always 1,0 so there is maximum of 16,384 (4 bits) Class B networks.  The rist octet runs from 128 to 191 so the range of host addresses is 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255.

* Class C addresses use the first three octets. The first two digits are 110.  The first octet has values from 192 to 223.  They range from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

IP addresses can be asigned manually or dunamically. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assignm IP addresses. **ipcal** can be used to calcualte manufal IP addresse.  

**Name Resolution** is used to convert numerical IP address values to human-readable format known as **hostname**. For example, 140.211.169.4 is the numerical IP address for **linuxfondation.org**.  The **localhost** is associated with the IP address 127.0.0.1 and descibes the machine that you are on. 

`cat /etc/hosts` will give the contents of the `cat/etc/resolv.conf`.  To look up hosts `host linuxfoundation.org` will display the IP address for linuxfoundation. 
***Network interfaces**
These are connection channels between a device and a network. Physically, the proceed through a network interface card(NIC). `ifconfig` command will report interfaces.  Network configuration files will ensure that the interfaces function correctly.  These will be in `/etc/network/interfaces/`.   `/etc/init.d/networkingstart` will start networking configuration. To view the IP address, `/sbin/ip addr show`.   To view routing informatio, `/sbin/ip route show`

`ping <hostname>` will check whether a host can receive and broadcast data.

###Routing
A network has nodes and the **routing tables** show the IP address of each node as well as the *IP routing protocols*. Use `route -n` to see table. 

## Networking tools

* `ethtool` queries network interfaces and set parameters. 
* `netstat` shows the active connections and data
* `nmap` scans open ports
* `tcpdump` dumps network traffic for analysis
* `iptraf` monitors network traffic. 

## Browsers
Download without using a browswer.  Use `wget`

* Large files
* Recursive downloads (one refers to another)
* Password required 
* Multiple file download

Use `wget <url>` will read page as a local file.

Use `curl` to get URL information. It can also allow saving of page contents. Use `curl -c saved.html http://www.mysite.com` will save the contents of mysite to saved.html. 

## Transfering files
File transfer protocol: ftp. Client-server model uses a server and a number of clients. 

Command line ftp clients

* ftp
* sftp: uses secure shell (ssh).  Encripts data but does not work with analymous clients like ftp.
* ncftp
* yafc

`ftp -p aristotle.learningmate.com` will make connection, ask for username and password and make the link.  To look at files and transwer use `ls` and `get`. 

**secure shell (SSH)** is used for secure data communication. To run `my_command` on remote system via SSH, use `ssh <remote system? my_command`.  You may be asked for a password but this may also be overriden. 

Files can be moved using **secured copy (scp)**.  To copy a local file to a remote system, `scp <local file> <user@remotesystem>:/home/user`

###Manipulating text

* `cat filename` 
* `cat file1 file2` brings together two files
* `cat file1 file2 > newfile>` put together in new file
* `cat file1 file2 >> newfile>` append
* `cat > file` any subsequent lines go into the file (until CNTR=D is pressed)
* `cat >> file` appended until control-D
* `tac` will print lines backwards
* `echo` will print to screen or file
* `echo >> file1` will append to file 1. 
* `echo` with switch `-e` will allow `\n` newlines and `\t` tabs

Use `sed` as one text editor. 

* `sed -e command < filename`
* `sed -f scriptfile < filename`
* `sed s/pattern/replace_string/ file` replaces first instance of patter with replace_string
* `sed s/pattern/replace_string/ file/g` same but all instances
* `1,3s/pattern/replace_string/ file/g` same but only lines 1 to 3
* `-i s/pattern/replace_string/ file/g` same but same but save changes
* `-i s/pattern/replace_string/ file/g file1 > file2` same but safer because changes can be inspected before deletion of old file

Use `awk` to extract specific contents of a file. 
* `awk 'command' var=value file` specify a commmand at the command line
* `awk -f scriptfile var=value file` specify a script file
* `awk '{ print $0 }' /etc/passwd` print entire file
* `awk -F: '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd` Print first field (column) of every line
* `awk -F: '{ print $1 $6}' /etc/passwd` Print first and sixth field of every line


##File management
File manipulation programmes
* `sort` Arrange lines of text according to the sort key. `-u` will sort only unique.
* `uniq` Remove duplicate lines.  Must be consequtive (therefore run sort first).  `uniq -c` will count the duplicate lines 
* `paste` joins two files together. `-d` specifies the delimiters; delimiters can be "space", "tab", "|" etc;`-s` append rather than horizontal join.
* `join` joins two files based on a common field. 
* `split` will split a file into equal size segments. This will leave the original file and will break into 1000 line segments. 

###Regular expressions
* (dot) Match any single character
* a|z Match a or z
* $ Match end of string
* * Match preceeding item 0 or more times

Example: "The quick brown fox jumpted over the lazy dog"

* a.. matches "azy"
* b.|j. matches both "br" and "ju"
* ..$ matches "og"
* l.*y matches "lazy""
* the.* matches the whole sentence. 

###`grep`
Text searching tool

* `grep [pattern] <filename>` prints all lines with matching pattern
* `grep -v [pattern] <filename>` prints all lines without the pattern
* `grep [0-9] <filename>` prints all lines with numbers 0 to 9
* `grep -C 3 [pattern] <filename>` prints context of lines matching pattern.  Here three lines above and below.

###`tr`
Used for translating one character for another

`tr [options] set1 set2`
One or two options are required.  Will substitute set2 for set1. 

* `cat city | tr a-z A-Z` will translate all the lower case letters in city to upper case
* `tr '{}' '[]' <inputfile> <outputfile>` changes braces to parenthesis
* `tee` takes output from a command and sends it to a file
* `wc` counts `-l` lines, `-w` words or `-c` bytes
* `cut` can extract a specific column. It assumes that columns are separated by a tab

###Large files
These can be loaded using `less` this does not put it into memory.

* `less <filename>`
* `cat <filename> less`
* `head` shows the first few lines
* `tail -n 14` last 14 lines.

### Zip files
* `zcat compressed-file.txt.gz` To view compressed file
* `zless <filename>` or `zmore <filename>` to page through zip
* `zgrep` search inside zip
* `zdiff` find differences in file.

# Printing
Linux standard for printing is **Common UNIX printing system** (CUPS). 

* Scheduler: Manages the print jobs.  
* COnfiguration:  scheduler reads configuration files. The most important are **cupsd.conf** (mostly for security and access rights) and **printers.conf**. These are stored in `/etc/cups/`.  
* `ip` or `ipr` commands can be used to print from the command line
* `ip <filename>` prints file.
* `ip -d printer <filemame>` prints to a specific printer
* `programme | lp echo string | lp` prints the output of a programme
* `lpq -a` show the que status
* `lpaadmin` configure que status

# Introduction to scripts
Use shell scripts.  Most common is *bash*.  Shell is a **commanline interpreter**.  

`#!/bin/bash`
`find. -name "*.c" -ls`

The command interpreter will execute statements that are found in the script. Interpreters

* `/usr/bin/perl`
* `/bin/bash`
* `/bin/csh`
* `/usr/bin/python`
* `/bin/sh`

Choices are listed in `/etc/shells`.  The default is bash. This can be overridden. 

`bash <script>` will send the script file to the shell interpreter. 

## Special characters
* # used for comments
* \ used to continue on to next line
* ; to have a second commmand on same line
* $ indicates that what follows is a variable
* joining commands wit && will stop subsequent actions when one fails
* joining commands with || will continue until one command succeeds

###Functions

* Declare a function 
* Call a function

syntax
```
function_name () {
  command ...
}
```
arguments that are passed to the function are usually named $1 and $2 etc. 

```
#!bin/bash
display() {
  echo "This is a message from the function"
  echo "The parameter passed from the calling process is" $1
}
display "Bob"
```

###Commands can be divided into the following categories
* Compiled applications: binary executable files that are on the filesystem. The shell script always has access to things like `rm`, `ls`, `df`, `vi`, `gzip`. 
* Built in **bash** commands: built-in bash commands that can be used in the shell. These include `cd`, `pwd`, `read`, `logout`, `printf`, `let`. A complete list is found on `bash man`. 
* Other scripts

###Command substitution
Sometimes it is necessary to substitute the result of a command to the inoput of another commmand. THered are two methods

* Enclosing the inner command with backticks (`)
* Enclosing the inner command in $

Example 
`cd /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/`
The output of the command `umame -r` becomes the argument for cd. 

###Environemnt variables
Environment variables supply inputs, validation and control behaviour. A list of environment variables is found with `env`, `set` and `printenv` commands. 

`$HOME` shows the HOME environment variable, 
`MYCOLOR=blue` sets the MYCOLOR environment variable as blue. 

###Exporting variables
Variables that are created are only available to that script.  To make them more widely available, they must be promosted to **environment variables** using the `export` command. 

Example
`export VAR=value` or `VAR=value; export VAR`

###Script parameters
It is often necessary to pass parameter values to a script. Within a script, the parameter or an argument is represented by $ and a number. 

* $0 is the script name
* $1 the first parameter
* $2, $3 second and third parameters
* $* all the parameters
* $# number of arguments

For example, 
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "The name of the script is:" $0
echo "The name of the first argument is" $1
echo "The name of the second argument is:" $2
```

###Output redirection
The character `>` is used to write the output of a file to another file.  `free > /tmp/free.out` will send the output of fee to the free-out file. `>>` will append the file. 

###Input redirection
Just as output can be rediected, input can be taken from another file. The `<` is used for input. 

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Line Count"
wc -l < /temp/free.cut
```
will count the lines in free.cut

## Constructs
The if statement will be based on numeric or string comparisons, truth or faliure and file existence. 

```
if condition
then
  statement
else
  statement
fi
```
for example, 
```
if [-f /etc/passwd]
then
  echo "/etcpassed exists"
fi
```
List of things that could be checke

* `-a file` does file exist
* `-d file` is file a directory
* `-f file` is it a regular file (not symbolic link)
* `s file` is it of non-zero size
* `g file` hs sgid set?
* `-u file` has suid set?
* `-r file` is file readable
* `-w file` is file writable
* `x file` is it executable

`man l test` will give the full list

Numerical tests

* `-eq` equal to
* `-ne` not equal to
* `-gt` greater than 
* `-lt` less than 
* `-ge` greater or equal than
* `-le` less of equal to
